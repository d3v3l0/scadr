			<h3>what.is.<span>SCADS</span>?</h3>
			<p>
				Collaborative web applications such as <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> and <a href="http://www.yelp.com">Yelp</a> present new challenges for storing and 
				querying large amounts of data. As users and developers are focused more on performance than single copy 
				consistency or the ability to perform ad-hoc queries, there exists an opportunity for a highly-scalable 
				system tailored specifically for relaxed consistency and pre-computed queries. The Web<sup>2.0</sup> development model 
				demands the ability to both rapidly deploy new features and automatically scale with the number of users. 
				There have been many <a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/bigtable.html">successful</a> <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/AllThingsDistributed/sosp/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf">distributed</a> <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/chord/">key-value</a> <a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/">stores</a>, but so far none provide as rich a query 
				language as SQL. We propose a new architecture, SCADS, that allows the developer to declaratively state 
				application specific consistency requirements, takes advantage of utility computing to provide cost 
				effective scale-up and scale-down, and will use machine learning models to introspectively anticipate 
				performance problems and predict the resource requirements of new queries before execution.
